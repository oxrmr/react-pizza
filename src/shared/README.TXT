According to the Feature Sliced Design,
this layer should contain:
  -the route components for each page in the app
  ðŸ“‚ ui/ â€” the UI kit, pure appearance, no business logic. For example, buttons, modal dialogs, form inputs.
  ðŸ“‚ api/ â€” convenience wrappers around request making primitives (like fetch() on the Web) and, optionally, functions for triggering particular requests according to the backend specification.
  ðŸ“‚ config/ â€” parsing environment variables
  ðŸ“‚ i18n/ â€” configuration of language support
  ðŸ“‚ router/ â€” routing primitives and route constants
